# Introduction


- There are various types of data such as nominal, categorical, continuous and discreet. 
- We are surrounded by all this data types especially categorical data.
- In this presentation I would like show association between categorical variable.
- Hence, Chi-square test of association will be implemented to Hypothesis testing.   



# Problem Statement



- Is there an association between exposure to irradiation, tumor size, and menopause and recurrence of breast cancer?
- Using Chi-square test association we will investigate the between these attributes and recurrence of breast cancer.

# Data

- The data is retrieved form UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
- The data was collected directly from the website of the repository. 
- It can be accessed from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases.
```{r}
df <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/breast-cancer.data"

bc_df <- read.delim(df, header = TRUE, sep=",")

names(bc_df) <- c("Class", "age_group", "menopause", "tumor_size", "inv-nodes", "node_caps", "deg_malig", "breast", "breast_quad", "irradiat")

bc_df$deg_malig <- as.character(bc_df$deg_malig)

bc_df$Class <- as.factor(bc_df$Class)
bc_df$irradiat <- as.factor(bc_df$irradiat)
bc_df$tumor_size <- as.factor(bc_df$tumor_size)
bc_df$menopause <- as.factor(bc_df$menopause)
bc_df$node_caps <- as.factor(bc_df$node_caps)
bc_df$breast_quad <- as.factor(bc_df$breast_quad)

bc_df$Class %>% table() %>% prop.table()
```

# Data Cont.

- The data set has multivariate characteristics.
- The attributes has categorical characteristics. 
- It has 289 instances and 9 attributes.
- It was saved as a .dat file with no column head.
- The column head was assigned while loading the data set.

```{r}
str(bc_df) 
```

# Descriptive Statistics and Visualisation

- "Class", "irradiat", "tumor_size" and "menopause" are considered as important attributes in this presentation.
- Class is treated as a factor with 2 levels as "no-recurrence-events" and "recurrence-events".
- "Use visualisation to highlight interesting features of the data and tell the overall story".
- "deg_malig" is converted from int to char. 
- No outliers, and some instance was found with "?" symbol and replced by NA
- All NA was replaced by mode using imputation

```{r warning=FALSE}
bc_df$breast_quad[ bc_df$breast_quad == "?" ] <- NA
bc_df$node_caps[ bc_df$node_caps == "?" ] <- NA

bc_df$node_caps <- impute(bc_df$node_caps, fun = mode)
bc_df$breast_quad <- impute(bc_df$breast_quad, fun = mode)
sum(is.na(bc_df))
```

# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- We create tables that associate each attribute of interest with "Class".
- The data is composed of 70% no recurrence and 30% recurrence events in Class variable.
- The first one is "irradiat" with "Class" ("irradiat" = exposed to radiation: yes or no)

```{r}
table(bc_df$irradiat, bc_df$Class) -> table1
knitr::kable(table1)
```
# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- We create visual summary to help explain the potential association between the two variables.
- "irradiat" with "Class"
```{r}
table_ir <- table(bc_df$irradiat, bc_df$Class) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
barplot(table_ir,ylab="Proportion Within Class",
        ylim=c(0,1),legend=rownames(table_ir),beside=TRUE,
        args.legend=c(x = "top",horiz=TRUE,title="irradiate"),
        xlab="irradiate", col = brewer.pal(5, name = "Reds"))
```


# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- The second one is "Tumor size" with "Class": ("Tumor size": size of breast tumors at diagnosis in mm)

```{r}
table(bc_df$tumor_size, bc_df$Class) -> table2
knitr::kable(table2)
```
# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- We create visual summary to help explain the potential association between the two variables.
- "Tumor size" with "Class"
```{r}
table_ts <- table(bc_df$tumor_size, bc_df$Class) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
barplot(table_ts,ylab="Proportion Within Class",
        ylim=c(0,.5),legend=rownames(table_ts),beside=TRUE,
        args.legend=c(x = "topleft",horiz=TRUE,title="Tumor Size"),
        xlab="Tumor Size", col = brewer.pal(5, name = "Blues"))
```

# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- The third one is "Menopause" with "Class" ("Menopause": ge40: greater than 40, lt40: less than 40, premono: around menopause)

```{r}
table(bc_df$menopause, bc_df$Class) -> table4
knitr::kable(table4)
```

# Decsriptive Statistics Cont.

- We create visual summary to help explain the potential association between the two variables.
- "Menopause" with "Class"
```{r}
table_mn <- table(bc_df$menopause, bc_df$Class) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
barplot(table_mn,ylab="Proportion Within Class",
        ylim=c(0,.8),legend=rownames(table_mn),beside=TRUE,
        args.legend=c(x = "topright",horiz=TRUE,title="Menopause"),
        xlab="Menopause", col = brewer.pal(5, name = "Greens"))
```


# The statistical hypotheses for the Chi-square test of association 

$$H_0: There\ is \ no \ association \ in \ the \ population \ between \ 1.\ "irradiation" \ and \ "class",$$
$$2.\ "tumore \ "size" \ and \ "Class", \ 3. \ "menopause" and "Class"\ variables \ (independence)$$
$$H_A: There \ is \ an \ association \ in \ the \ population \ between \ 1.\ "irradiation" \ and \ "class",$$
$$\ 2.\ "tumore \ "size" \ and \ "Class", \ 3. \ "menopause" and "Class"\ variables \ (dependence) $$
- Assumption

  - No more than 25% of the cells have expected counts below 5. 
  
- Decision Rule

  - Reject $H_0$:
  
      - if $p-value$ is less than 0.05 ($\alpha$ significance level)
      
- Conclusion 

  - Reject $H_0$:
  
    - if test is statistically significant.
    
  - Otherwise, the test is not statistically significant.

- We have done the statistical hypotheses for this Chi-square test of association using R

- For "irradiat" "tumor size" and "menopause" attributes and see their association with the recurrence of breast cancer respectively.


# Chi-square Test of Association using R for "irradiat"
```{r}
chi_ir <- chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$irradiat))
chi_ir
```

```{r}
chi_ir$observed
```


```{r}
chi_ir$expected
```

- One-tailed hypothesis test for "Irradiate" using $\alpha$ = 0.05 and $df$ = 1
```{r}
qchisq(p = .95,df = 1)
```
- The critical value was found to be 9.49. We reject $H_0$ as 9.6374 > 3.841459

- To confirm the $p-value$ computed above, we run the following code
```{r}
chi_irr<-chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$irradiat))
chi_irr$p.value
```

# Hypothesis testing cont.for "Tumor size"
```{r warning=FALSE}
chi_ts <- chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$tumor_size))
chi_ts
```
```{r}
chi_ts$observed
```


```{r}
chi_ts$expected
```

- One-tailed hypothesis test for "Tumor size" using $\alpha$ = 0.05 and $df$ = 10
```{r}
qchisq(p = .95,df = 10)
```
- The critical value was found to be 18.30. We do not reject $H_0$ as 18.30 =  18.30

- To confirm the $p-value$ computed above, we run the following code
```{r warning=FALSE}
chi_tss<-chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$tumor_size))
chi_tss$p.value
```


# Hypothesis testing cont.for "Menopause"
```{r warning=FALSE}
chi_mp <- chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$menopause))
chi_mp
```
```{r}
chi_mp$observed
```

```{r}
chi_ts$expected
```
- One-tailed hypothesis test for "Menopause" using $\alpha$ = 0.05 and $df$ = 2
```{r}
qchisq(p = .95,df = 2)
```
- The critical value was found to be 0.8589. We do not reject $H_0$ as  0.8589 < 5.991465

- To confirm the $p-value$ computed above, we run the following code
```{r warning=FALSE}
chi_mps<-chisq.test(table(bc_df$Class, bc_df$menopause))
chi_mps$p.value
```
# Discussion

- From the Chi-square Test of Association using R we get the following results

  - Irradiat: 
  
        - 0% of expected cell counts were less than 5.
        
        - x-square = 9.6374  and degree of freedom = 1. 
        
        - The critical value (3.841459) is is less than the observed value (9.6374).
        
        - p-value = 0.001 which is < .05.
        
        - Reject the null hypothesis.
        
- The results of this study suggest there was a statistically significant association between recurrence of breast cancer and exposure of radiation in women who treated with breast cancer.

  - Tumor size: 
  
        - More than 0% of expected cell counts were less than 5,
        
        - x-square = 18.3  and degree of freedom  = 10, 
        
        - The critical value (18.30) is is equal to the observed value (18.30),
        
        - p-value = 0.05 which is = .05,
        
        - Can not reject the Null hypothesis (Reject the alternative hypothesis).
    
- The results of this study suggest that there is no statistically significant relationship between tumor size and recurrence of cancer in women who treated with breast cancer.    

# Discussion cont.

  - Menopause: 
  
        - More than 0% of expected cell counts were less than 5,
        
        - x square = 0.8589, and degree of freedom = 2,
        
        - The critical value (5.991465) is is greater than the observed value (0.8589),
        
        - p-value = 0.65 which is > .05,
        
        - Can not reject the Null hypothesis (Reject the alternative hypothesis).
  
- The results of this study suggest that there is no statistically significant relationship between menopause and recurrence of cancer in women who treated with breast cancer. 

- A Chi-square test of association was used to test for a statistically significant association between recurrence of breast cancer and exposure of radiation "irradiate", tumor size and menopause separately. The results of the test found a statistically significant association between exposure for radiation "irradiate" and recurrence of breast cancer, $X^2$=18.3, $p$ < .05

# Discussion cont.

- The results of this study suggest that women who treated with breast cancer were more likely to experience recurrence of breast cancer categories when exposed to radiation compared to non-ruccerence.

- The Limitation of this study is the size of the data set.

- The result would be different if the data set were larger.

- We can say that using a statistical method we can predict the possibility of different outcomes and draw a statistical inference.

- Chi square method is a very good tool to be used as a feature selection tool.
